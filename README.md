## 👋🏾 Hi, I'm Kazeem Asiwaju-Bello (@asiwajudev)

I'm an **Enterprise & Cloud Architect** and **Platform Engineer** with deep experience designing scalable, secure, and API-first platforms in fintech, SaaS, and logistics. I focus on building systems that are not only robust and cloud-native but also empower engineering teams to deliver with speed and confidence.

### 🚀 What I Do

- Architect and implement **event-driven**, **microservice-based** systems using best practices in DDD, CQRS, and secure SDLC.
- Lead engineering teams through **digital transformation**, **DevSecOps** adoption, and platform standardization.
- Build **developer tooling**, define **code quality automation**, and mentor developers on best practices and clean architecture.
- Enable organizations to scale through well-architected **cloud platforms** and **API ecosystems**.
